Bisq is built on some https://bisq.network/philosophy/[serious principles^] and some https://github.com/bisq-network[seriously impressive code^], but it's surprisingly approachable. This guide will help you get up & running quickly.

Here we're going to assume you want to trade a national currency for bitcoin, because that's Bisq's most common use case. But keep in mind Bisq offers trading for a range of altcoins too—the only constraint is that one side of the trade must always be in bitcoin.

== Download & install

To run Bisq, download it from https://bisq.network/downloads/[the Bisq downloads page]. Before installing, it's a good idea to verify the signatures of the downloaded file (https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en[instructions here^]).

[NOTE]
.Download and install? Why can't I just trade on your website?
====
Unlike most exchanges, Bisq doesn't run a central server to receive orders.

Instead, when you place an order on Bisq, it's routed to a global network of people who are also running Bisq's software on their own computers.

If you want to tap into this network, you've got to run the software too!
====

Once the installer is done, go ahead and open Bisq. It'll take a few moments to open as it connects to Tor and Bisq's peer-to-peer trading network.

[[[Once it does, it'll ask you to set up a wallet...]]]

[[[discuss first-time application/wallet setup]]]

When that's done, feel free to have a look around Bisq. You can browse buy offers, sell offers, and tweak your account settings.

== Configure a national currency account

Since we're looking to buy bitcoin, let's take a look at the Buy BTC panel. You should see a list of offers, but you'll notice all the orange Buy BTC buttons are disabled:

.Here, all offers are disabled except the one requiring a US Postal Money Order, since there's no account to configure for that method.

That's because we haven't set a way to actually pay for the bitcoin we want to buy. Bisq works with several payment methods, so you can pick one you're most comfortable with. Keep in mind that the one you pick will determine:

* which offers you can take (e.g., in the image above, Cash App has many outstanding offers...but if you don't want to use Cash App, and if there are no offers for the payment method you want, you can make your own offer & wait for a taker)
* how quickly a trade can be completed (e.g., a bank transfer will go through quicker than a money order sent by mail; see https://bisq.network/faq/#5[details here^])

[NOTE]
.Where is my financial account data stored?
====
On your computer *only* (i.e., the computer on which Bisq is installed). Only your trading partner (and your arbitrator, if there's a dispute) will ever see your payment details.
====

Once you've picked a payment method, go to the Account panel and click "Add New Account." Pick your payment method from the dropdown and enter your details. 

We're going to configure a Venmo account:

.Configuring a Venmo account. In this case, we only need to edit the full name & username fields.

It's *crucial* the information you enter here is correct. Your trading partner can only acknowledge your payment if the they receive a payment from the same account as the account detailed here. Once you've created an account, you cannot edit its information (if you need to make a change, you can delete & add the account again).

The "Account Name" field is an exception: it's just a label only you will ever see, so there's no right or wrong value for it. You can make it whatever you like.

Once you're done, hit the "Save New Account" button and go back to the Buy BTC panel. Offers requiring the payment method you just configured should now be enabled:

== Fund your Bisq wallet

We're almost there—last thing: before you buy bitcoin with Bisq, you'll need some bitcoin.

Huh?

Here's why: to encourage fair trades, Bisq requires buyers and sellers to post a security deposit. On the buy side, it's {btc_deposit} BTC, along with a tiny bit more to cover the trading fee & mining fees for the transfers.

[NOTE]
.I'm new to this and have no bitcoin. How can I get bitcoin for the deposit?
====
You can buy bitcoin on a centralized exchange, but if you're interested in Bisq, chances are you might not want to do that.

So what can you do? You've got options: friends, family, bitcoin ATMs, bitcoin meetups (commonly called "Satoshi Squares" but there are many others), vouchers, a site like LocalBitcoins.com, or your https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbmWGrQjgTA[friendly neighborhood airdrop^] (although you might need to time-travel to find one of these now!).
====

To find out exactly how much bitcoin you need to execute a specific trade, choose an offer you like. A new "Take Offer" tab will appear with some deal details. Click "Next step" at the bottom. Accept the disclaimer, and you should see a box that looks like this:

<screenshot of box specifying total needed to fund trade>
[[[caption: In this case, you'll need 0.012184 BTC to start the trade.]]]

Once you've got the bitcoin you need, you can move it into Bisq's built-in wallet. This isn't required, but it'll make trading more convenient because Bisq could automatically transfer the funds it needs (since they'll be stored in a wallet Bisq controls). Otherwise, you'll need to transfer the funds into Bisq every time you start a trade. More on this below.

Now that you've got enough bitcoin for a deposit, you're ready to trade!

== Place a trade

Now for the fun part! Let's actually place a trade.

[[[--following would be a numbered list with abundant screenshots--]]]

[[[find an offer]]]

[[[send deposit to trade wallet--if enough btc in bisq wallet, this is automatic; otherwise, send to trade wallet yourself (need to specify >20 sat/b mining fee?)]]]

[[[confirm trade]]]

[[[send payment! this varies...but bisq will guide you. screenshot will show user must wait for 1 confirmation before sending payment]]]

[[[once you send payment, make sure you tell bisq you've sent it (easy to forget); admonition: good chance to remind users that bisq doesn't actually integrate with fiat payment channels?]]]

[[[wait for seller to receive]]]

...

[[[complete trade]]]

== Get help

[[[bisq has presence on many channels...but which are preferred for support? forums, reddit, github...any/all?]]]

== Stay in touch

If Bitcoin's motto is "be your own bank" then Bisq's motto is "be your own exchange." It's an exciting concept, it's growing fast, and it's something you'll want to follow.

[[[encourage follow on twitter, facebook, telegram, youtube, reddit...any/all/others? looks like email list is retired]]]
