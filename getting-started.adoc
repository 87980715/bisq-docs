Bisq is built on some https://bisq.network/philosophy/[serious principles^] and some https://github.com/bisq-network[seriously impressive code^], but it's surprisingly approachable. This guide will help you get up & running quickly.

Here we're going to assume you want to trade a national currency for bitcoin, since that's how most people get started with Bisq. But keep in mind Bisq offers trading for a range of other coins too—the only constraint is that one side of the trade must always be in bitcoin.

== Download & install

To run Bisq, download it from https://bisq.network/downloads/[the Bisq downloads page]. _Optional:_ before installing, verify the signatures of the downloaded file (https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en[instructions here^]) to be sure the file you downloaded is genuine.

[NOTE]
.Why do I need to download software? Why can't I just trade on your website?
====
Unlike most exchanges, Bisq doesn't run a central server to take/place offers, so trading on a website isn't possible.

Instead, Bisq routes trades through a peer-to-peer network—a global network of people who are also running Bisq's software on their own computers.

If you want to tap into this network, you've got to download & run the software too!
====

Once the installer is done, go ahead and open Bisq. It'll take a few moments to open as it connects to Tor and Bisq's peer-to-peer trading network.

When that's done, feel free to have a look around Bisq. You can browse buy offers, sell offers, and tweak your account settings.

== Configure a national currency account

Since we're looking to buy bitcoin, let's take a look at the Buy BTC panel. You should see a list of offers, but you'll notice all the orange Buy BTC buttons are disabled:

.Before configuring a payment account: all offers are disabled.
image::before-adding-fiat-account.png[Offers disabled before configuring national currency account]

That's because we haven't set a way to actually pay for the bitcoin we want to buy. So let's set up a payment method. Bisq works with many different payment methods, so you can choose those you already have access to & are most comfortable using. Keep in mind payment methods determine:

* which offers you can take right now (e.g., in the image above, Zelle has many outstanding offers, so if we set up Zelle, we could immediately take any of those offers)
* how quickly a trade can be completed (e.g., a bank transfer will go through quicker than a money order sent by mail; see https://bisq.network/faq/#5[details here^])

[NOTE]
.What if there are no outstanding offers for the payment method I want to use?
====
If you don't see any offers for the payment method you want to use, consider checking back later. A Bisq offer is only available while the user making the offer is online and running Bisq, so you'll see offers come and go as Bisq users around the world go online and offline throughout the day.

You can also create your own buy offer with the "Create New Offer to Buy BTC with USD" button on the bottom-right, but we won't go into those details here.
====

[NOTE]
.Where is my payment account data stored?
====
On your computer *only* (i.e., the computer on which Bisq is installed). Only your trading partner (and your arbitrator, if there's a dispute) will ever see your payment details.
====

In this tutorial, we're going to configure a Zelle account. You can adapt the instructions that follow to the payment method you choose.

Go to the Account panel and click "Add New Account." Pick Zelle from the dropdown and enter your details. 

For Zelle, we need to enter Full Name and Email/Mobile Number.

.Configuring a Zelle account.

You don't need to edit the "Salt" field. You can keep the "Account Name" unchanged or make it whatever you like: it's just a label only you will ever see, so there's no right or wrong value for it.

IMPORTANT: It's *crucial* the information you enter here is correct. Your trading partner can only acknowledge your payment if it's from the account detailed here. Once you've created an account, you cannot edit its information (if you need to make a change, you can delete & add the account again).

Once you're done, hit the "Save New Account" button and go back to the Buy BTC panel. Offers requiring the payment method you just configured should now be enabled:

.After configuring a payment account: we picked Zelle, so Zelle offers are now enabled.

== Fund your Bisq wallet

We're almost there—last thing: before you buy bitcoin with Bisq, you'll need some bitcoin.

Huh?

Here's why: to prevent fraud, Bisq requires buyers and sellers to post a security deposit. On the buy side, it's {btc-deposit} BTC, along with a trading fee & mining fees for the transfers.

[NOTE]
.I'm new to this and have no bitcoin. How can I get bitcoin for the deposit?
====
You've got options. Do you have any friends or  family who could help? Otherwise, try: bitcoin ATMs, bitcoin meetups, vouchers.
====

[WARNING]
.Why not use an exchange like Coinbase?
====
Most centralized exchanges (like Coinbase) track your personal information, putting you at risk by tying your identity with your bitcoin.

Bisq is built from the ground up to avoid this privacy fiasco, so we highly recommend you get your first bitcoin through one of the channels mentioned above.

.This trade requires 0.010152 BTC to start.
image::temp/deposit-amount.png[See exact deposite amount,400,400]

To find out exactly how much bitcoin you need to execute a specific trade, choose an offer you like. A new "Take Offer" tab will appear with some deal details. Click "Next Step" at the bottom. Accept the disclaimer, and you'll see a box that tells you how much bitcoin you'll need to start that trade.

Once you've got the bitcoin you need, you can move it into Bisq's built-in wallet. This isn't required, but it'll make trading more convenient because it'll allow Bisq to automatically transfer the funds it needs for the trade (since they'll be stored in a wallet Bisq controls). Otherwise, you'll need to transfer the funds into Bisq yourself when you trade. More on this below.

== Take an offer

:figure-caption: Figure

Now that we've gotten setup out of the way, let's do a trade.

=== 1. Select an offer

[.float-group]
--
[.right.text-center]
.Hit this button to select an offer.
image::temp/select-an-offer.png[Select an offer,400,400]

Click the orange "Buy BTC" button for an offer you want to take.

--

=== 2. Send deposit to trade wallet

[.float-group]
--
[.right.text-center]
.In this case, we need to send 0.010176 BTC to 1PKcJWzPeLjUo6WkaWKxLbyBmikWtXgpce.
image::temp/deposit-details.png[Deposit details,400,400]

Once you've chosen an offer, a special trade wallet is created to hold both parties' bitcoin (yours and the seller's) while you send payment to the seller.

It works like an escrow account: funds can only be released once you and the seller have satisfied your ends of the deal.

Bisq will tell you exactly how much you need to deposit in this account. 

* If you already have enough bitcoin in a Bisq wallet, the funds will be sent to the trade wallet automatically.
* If not, go ahead and send the amount required to the trade wallet (see Figure 2). [[[minimum miner fee??]]]
--

[NOTE]
.An escrow account? How does that work?
====
Bisq never holds any bitcoin or national currency. The trade wallet is actually a 2-of-3 multisignature setup involving you, the seller, and a https://bisq.network/faq/#8[bonded arbitrator^]. More details are https://bisq.network/faq/#18[here^] and you can read more about multisig wallets https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature[here^].
====

=== 3. Confirm trade

Once you've funded your trade wallet, hit the "Review: Take Offer to Buy Bitcoin" button.

Bisq will then show you all the details of the offer you're about to take.

.Make sure these details are correct. After you confirm these terms, you must follow through (or risk losing your deposit).
image::temp/confirm-deal.png[Confirm deal details]

If it all looks good, go ahead and hit "Confirm: Take Offer to Buy Bitcoin."

Your deal is now officially happening!

=== 4. Send payment

[.float-group]
--

[.right.text-center]
.Payment details pop-up.
image::temp/seller-payment-details.png[Seller payment details,400,400]

Before showing you the seller's payment details, Bisq will wait for the seller's transaction to confirm. This will take _approximately_ 10 minutes.

Then, you'll see a pop-up with the seller's details. Now it's your job to pay the seller through the agreed payment method. 

Note the remaining time indicator: your payment must reach the seller before that timer runs out. So don't stall!

[NOTE]
.Wait for more confirmations?
====
You'll notice that Bisq mentions you can wait for more confirmations before sending payment.

Why might you do that? It has to do with the way Bitcoin transactions are validated: each confirmation makes a transacation exponentially harder to reverse.

=== 5. Mark payment as sent

[.float-group]

.Mark payment as sent.
image::temp/mark-payment-sent.png[Mark payment as sent,400,400]

Once you've sent your payment, be sure to mark the payment as sent in Bisq.

It's easy to forget this step, but remember: to maximize your privacy, Bisq doesn't integrate with national currency payment methods—so it won't know you've sent your payment until you tell it.

--

=== 6. Complete trade

[.float-group]
--

[.right.text-center]
.Trade complete!
image::temp/complete-trade.png[Complete trade,400,400]

When the seller receives your payment, they'll mark it as received in Bisq. Bisq will then complete the trade by releasing the bitcoin you bought to you (along with your deposit).

You can keep your new bitcoin in Bisq, or send it wherever you'd like.

Congratulations. You've just completed your first trade on Bisq!
