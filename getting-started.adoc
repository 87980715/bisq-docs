Bisq is built on some https://bisq.network/philosophy/[serious principles^] and some https://github.com/bisq-network[seriously impressive code^], but it's surprisingly approachable. This guide will help you get up & running quickly.

Here we're going to assume you want to trade a national currency for bitcoin, since that's how most people get started with Bisq. But keep in mind Bisq offers trading for a range of other coins too—the only constraint is that one side of the trade must always be in bitcoin.

== Download & install

To run Bisq, download it from https://bisq.network/downloads/[the Bisq downloads page]. Before installing, it's a good idea to verify the signatures of the downloaded file (https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en[instructions here^]).

[NOTE]
.Download and install? Why can't I just trade on your website?
====
Unlike most exchanges, Bisq doesn't run a central server to take/place offers.

Instead, when you take/place offers on Bisq, it's routed to a global network of people who are also running Bisq's software on their own computers.

If you want to tap into this network, you've got to run the software too!
====

Once the installer is done, go ahead and open Bisq. It'll take a few moments to open as it connects to Tor and Bisq's peer-to-peer trading network.

[[[Once it does, it'll ask you to set up a wallet...]]]

[[[discuss first-time application/wallet setup]]]

When that's done, feel free to have a look around Bisq. You can browse buy offers, sell offers, and tweak your account settings.

== Configure a national currency account

Since we're looking to buy bitcoin, let's take a look at the Buy BTC panel. You should see a list of offers, but you'll notice all the orange Buy BTC buttons are disabled:

.Here, all offers are disabled except the one requiring a US Postal Money Order, since we haven't set up a way to configure an account for that method yet.

That's because we haven't set a way to actually pay for the bitcoin we want to buy. Bisq works with many different payment methods, so you can choose those you already have access to & are most comfortable using. Keep in mind that the one you pick will determine:

* which offers you can take (e.g., in the image above, Cash App has many outstanding offers...but if you don't want to use Cash App, and if there are no offers for the payment method you pick, you can make your own offer & wait for a taker)
* how quickly a trade can be completed (e.g., a bank transfer will go through quicker than a money order sent by mail; see https://bisq.network/faq/#5[details here^])

[NOTE]
.Where is my payment account data stored?
====
On your computer *only* (i.e., the computer on which Bisq is installed). Only your trading partner (and your arbitrator, if there's a dispute) will ever see your payment details.
====

In this tutorial, we're going to configure a Venmo account. You can adapt the instructions that follow to the payment method you choose.

Go to the Account panel and click "Add New Account." Pick Venmo from the dropdown and enter your details. 

.Configuring a Venmo account. In this case, we only need to edit the full name & username fields.

It's *crucial* the information you enter here is correct. Your trading partner can only acknowledge your payment if it's from the account detailed here. Once you've created an account, you cannot edit its information (if you need to make a change, you can delete & add the account again).

The "Account Name" field is an exception: it's just a label only you will ever see, so there's no right or wrong value for it. You can make it whatever you like.

Once you're done, hit the "Save New Account" button and go back to the Buy BTC panel. Offers requiring the payment method you just configured should now be enabled:

== Fund your Bisq wallet

We're almost there—last thing: before you buy bitcoin with Bisq, you'll need some bitcoin.

Huh?

Here's why: to prevent fraud, Bisq requires buyers and sellers to post a security deposit. On the buy side, it's {btc-deposit} BTC, along with a trading fee & mining fees for the transfers.

[NOTE]
.I'm new to this and have no bitcoin. How can I get bitcoin for the deposit?
====
You've got options. Do you have any friends or  family who could help? Otherwise, try: bitcoin ATMs, bitcoin meetups, and vouchers.
====

[WARNING]
.Why not use an exchange like Coinbase?
====
Most centralized exchanges (like Coinbase) track your personal information, putting you at risk by tying your identity with your bitcoin.

Bisq is built from the ground up to avoid this privacy fiasco, so we highly recommend you get your first bitcoin through one of the channels mentioned above.
====

To find out exactly how much bitcoin you need to execute a specific trade, choose an offer you like. A new "Take Offer" tab will appear with some deal details. Click "Next step" at the bottom. Accept the disclaimer, and you should see a box that looks like this:

<screenshot of box specifying total needed to fund trade>
[[[caption: In this case, you'll need 0.012184 BTC to start the trade.]]]

Once you've got the bitcoin you need, you can move it into Bisq's built-in wallet. This isn't required, but it'll make trading more convenient because it'll allow Bisq to automatically transfer the funds it needs for every trade (since they'll be stored in a wallet Bisq controls). Otherwise, you'll need to transfer the funds into Bisq yourself every time you trade. More on this below.

== Take an offer

Now that we've gotten setup out of the way, let's trade.

=== 1. Select an offer you like

=== 2. Send deposit to trade wallet

[[[send deposit to trade wallet--if enough btc in bisq wallet, this is automatic; otherwise, send to trade wallet yourself (need to specify >20 sat/b mining fee?)]]]

=== 3. Confirm trade

=== 4. Send payment

[[[send payment! this varies...but bisq will guide you. screenshot will show user must wait for 1 confirmation before sending payment]]]

=== 5. Mark payment as sent in Bisq

[[[once you send payment, make sure you tell bisq you've sent it (easy to forget); admonition: good chance to remind users that bisq doesn't actually integrate with fiat payment channels?]]]

=== 6. Complete trade
